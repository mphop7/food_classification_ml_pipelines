# food_classification_ml_pipelines
**Machine Learning Pipelines for Food Classification and Health Assessment**

**Basic Component**: Classified images from the MLEnd Yummy Dataset (3,250 meal images) to predict if a dish
contained rice or chips. Used Python libraries including OpenCV for pre-processing, Scikit-Image for feature
extraction, and Scikit-Learn for model development and evaluation.

**Advanced Component**: built a model to predict healthiness ratings of dishes based on visual features. Analysed attributes like colour distribution and texture using OpenCV, supported by Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualisation.
